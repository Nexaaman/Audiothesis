                        You are a professional podcast scriptwriter. I need you to create engaging and detailed podcast episodes based on the following research content.

                        ### Requirements:
                        - Tone: Conversational, simple, and engaging (targeting a general audience).
                        - Decide the number of episodes based on content length (5â€“7 episodes depending on content length).
                        - Target duration: Each script should provide enough content for at least 2  minutes of audio (~2000 characters).
                        - Content to cover:
                        1. An engaging hook to grab attention.
                        2. A deep dive into the topic with clear explanations in layman's terms.
                        3. Use relatable examples, anecdotes, or analogies to make the topic engaging.
                        4. Summarize key takeaways.
                        5. Conclude with a teaser for the next episode.

                    - Include an engaging title.
                    - Provide a comprehensive script with a clear introduction, in-depth explanation, and engaging conclusion.
                    - Ensure the script is at max 2000 characters.
